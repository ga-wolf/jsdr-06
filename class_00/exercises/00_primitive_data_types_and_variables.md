# Exercises: Primitive Data Types and Variables

## How would you?

### Convert a string into a number?

- Create a variable called `num` and set it to `"4"`
- Update `num` by converting its value to the number it represents (e.g. `"4"` to `4`)
  - You may need to look up a function to do this! Try using MDN (hint: `parseInt` may help)
- Log the value of `num`
- Bonus: Do the same thing but with `"5.6"`

### Convert a number into a string?

- Create a variable that contains `15`
- Update it, by converting the value to a string (e.g. `15` into `"15"`)
- Log the result

### Make a string uppercased?

- Create a variable that contains `"hello"`
- Using a method that is available on all strings, uppercase it! (e.g. `"hello"` into `"HELLO"`)
- Log the result

**Bonus**: Make just the first character uppercased!

### Get the second character out of a string?

- Create a variable that contains `"hello"`
- Using a method, log out its second character (e.g. `"e"`)

### Use concatenation to combine two strings (e.g. join `"Hello "` and `"World"`)?

- Create two variables, called `firstName` and `lastName` (e.g. `"Jacques"`, and `"Cousteau"`)
- Create a new variable, called `fullName`, by combining those two strings!
- Log out `fullName` (and make sure there is a space between the first and last name!)
- Bonus: Try using the `prompt` method to get the user's `firstName` and `lastName` - then combine them

### Get a number and square it (e.g. `4` squared is `16`)?

- Create a variable that contains `16`
- Using a method, square it and log out the result
- Bonus: Do the same thing but cube it

### Get the square root of a number (e.g. square root of `25` is `5`)?

- Create a variable that contains `25`
- Using a method, get that variable's square root and log out the result
