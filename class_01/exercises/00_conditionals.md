# Exercises: Conditionals

## What number's bigger?

Write an `if` statement that compares two numbers (call them `numOne` and `numTwo`).

If numOne is bigger, it should log to the console `"numOne (THE VALUE) is bigger than numTwo (THE VALUE)"`.

If numTwo is bigger, it should log to the console `"numOne (THE VALUE) is smaller than numTwo (THE VALUE)"`.

If they are even, it should log to the console `"numOne (THE VALUE) is equal to numTwo (THE VALUE)"`.

**Bonus**: Get the two numbers using `prompt`!

**Bonus**: Use interpolation (you may need to look up [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals))

## Driving Age

Store the user's name and age.

- If the age is less than 16, log `"Sorry, you can't drive yet!"`
- If the age is greater than or equal to 16, log `"Drive into the sunset!"`

**Bonus**: Get the name and age using `prompt`!

**Bonus**: If the user can't drive yet, tell them how many years they have before they can drive (e.g. `"Sorry, you still have 4 years before you can drive"`)

## Say Hi!

Store a language (e.g. `"English"`, `"French"` or `"Malaysian"`)

- If the language is `"English"`, log `"Hi"`
- If the language is `"French"`, log `"Bonjour"`
- If the language is `"Norwegian"`, log `"Hallo"`
- If the language is `"Turkish"`, log `"Merhaba"`
- Plus, any other language you want to add!

## Southern or Northern Hemisphere?

Store a `latitude` (e.g. `65.3966675`, `-43.7251374`)

- If the `latitude` is less than 0, log `"Southern Hemisphere"`
- If the `latitude` is greater than 0, log `"Northern Hemisphere"`
- Otherwise, log `"On the equator"`

**Bonus:** Figure out if it is the Eastern or Western Hemisphere too!

## Year in the 19th, 20th or 21st Century?

Store a year (e.g. `1905`, `1814`)

- If the year is between 1801 and 1900, log `"19th Century"`
- If the year is between 1901 and 2000, log `"20th Century"`
- If the year is between 2001 and 2100, log `"21st Century"`
- Otherwise, log `"Sorry, it must be another century"`

## Greet

Store an `hour`, as 24 hour time (e.g. `9`, `16`)

- If `hour` is less than 10, log `"Good Morning"`
- Else if the `hour` is less than 19, log `"Good Day"`
- Otherwise, log `"Good Evening"`
